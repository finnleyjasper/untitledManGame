=== TOOLS & SERVICES:
         - We used Discord as our main communication channel, through text message as well as voice calls
         - We used Github and Github Desktop as our VCS
         - Art was done in Photoshop and Procreate
         - Sound was edited in Premiere Pro
         - Google Drive was used to share image files when appropriate (ie. for our pitch document)
         - Trello was used for task management and tracking
         - Jira was initially used to set up a visual timeline
         - Google Docs was used to prepare our pitch document
         - Indesign was used to format the pitch document

=== RESOURCES:
        - Unity docs: https://docs.unity3d.com/2023.2/Documentation/Manual/index.html
            -> Finnley visited this a lot when using components or functions he was not familiar with

        - MOST USED - For all mechanics similar to Pacman: https://youtu.be/TKt_VlMn_aA
            -> Finnley based Player, PlayerMovement, PointObject, Teleporter, and some of GameManager off of this video - pretty much anything covered in the video
               up until the ghost implementation.

        - For learning about coroutines: https://forum.unity.com/threads/what-is-the-best-way-to-delay-a-function.1002040/ & https://discussions.unity.com/t/toggling-a-sprite-renderer/135413/2
            -> Finnley had not heard of or used coroutines before, so these resources were used. Code was initially grabbed from here but as development progressed Finnley was able
               to write his own coroutines having used these references

        - Tilemap creation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E0w-YKQnd8
            -> David used this video to help develop the sprites for the tilemap and implement them in unity to build the map

        - UI Button animations: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMbEe0DBQnQm
            -> David and Finnley used this resource to help implement the button animations in our Main Menu

        - Updating text in the UI using text mesh pro: https://forum.unity.com/threads/changing-textmeshpro-text-from-ui-via-script.462250/ & https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDVGiJGTbZs
            -> Finnley used these resources to find out how to update text in the UI; previously he had only used the basic Text object from unity's old UI system so he had some trouble
               finding the correct way to update text using a text mesh pro object

        - Collision and sounds: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvYhw2nt36Y
            -> Edward had not coded anything before and used this video and Finnley's advice to implement sounds in the game

        - Picking random sounds to play: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqyzGntF5Hw
            -> As per previous resource; Finnley also referenced this when helping Edward

=== ASSETS:
        - Some code is referenced from the above Pacman video (second link, marked "MOST USED"), as well as the coroutine resources
